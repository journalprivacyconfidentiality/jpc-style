\begin{abstract}
  \noindent The abstract has to precede the maketitle command.  Be
  sure not to issue the maketitle command twice!  In the abstract,
  mathematical expressions must be kept to the absolute minimum.
  Otherwise it should consist of plain ASCII text, without
  \TeX-commands, including explicit references using the
  \texttt{\textbackslash cite} command.  Presently we are not able to
  automatically extract an abstract containing such data and reliably
  turn it into html code.  If you cannot meet these criteria, it is
  your responsibility to provide us with an html-version of your
  abstract.  Please keep the abstract fairy short to prevent it from
  spilling onto the second page!
